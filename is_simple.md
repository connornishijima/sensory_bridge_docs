# SENSORY BRIDGE is **SIMPLE**

**Easy controls provide quick access to changing the brightness, color, and smoothing of the display!** (Each knob has a UI that appears on your LED strip whenever you turn them.)

![photons](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/photons.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

PHOTONS
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Too bright? *Dim down the show* with the **PHOTONS** knob. (Sensory Bridge will use temporal dithering to keep producing color nicely at lower brightness levels.)

![chroma](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/chroma.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

CHROMA
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Custom color or color based on the music's notation? Choose your style with the **CHROMA** knob, where turning it all the way to the top enables a full-specrum mode that colors the LEDs based on the music notation. (Each octave is represented by one full revolution of the color wheel, i.e. D# in every octave is always yellow.)

![mood](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/mood.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

MOOD
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

This knob is special. **MOOD** controls *how quickly your LEDs will react to changes in pitch and volume!* A low "mood" will be very soft and gradual, only showing things like the underlying chord progression of a song, whereas a *high* "mood" will be extremely reactive, and can be a little too flashy for some people's liking. Luckily, you can blend the value to anywhere between those two extremes whenever you want to find what look you prefer!

![noise](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/noise.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

NOISE BUTTON
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Running the A/C? Is the washing machine suddenly on the spin cycle? Don't worry, just pause the music for a moment and press the **NOISE BUTTON** to run a 3-second calibration to *automagically* have noisy background ambience removed from your light show.

![mode](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/mode.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

MODE BUTTON
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

Sensory Bridge currently has 6 built-in light show modes that you can cycle through with a tap, and holding this button toggles the mirroring effect on the LED strip.

![sweet_spot](https://github.com/connornishijima/sensory_bridge_docs/blob/main/img/sweet_spot.svg?raw=true){: .sb-icon }

SWEET SPOT
{: .text-center .fs-7 .fw-700 }

At the front of Sensory Bridge are three LEDs which indicate if your music is playing too quietly or loudly for the auto-ranger to account for! That auto-ranging system make both quiet and loud music produce similar shows, so you don't have to keep adjusting your speakers.
