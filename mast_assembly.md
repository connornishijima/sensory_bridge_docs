# SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED

If you also ordered a Mini Mast, you'll need to remove the two small screws from the upper brace, and then you can insert the Mini Mast into Sensory Bridge as shown:

Take care that the Mini Mast is inserted correctly into the socket, and no loose metal pins are exposed. Your finished assembly should look like this:
